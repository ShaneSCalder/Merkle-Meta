# Merkle-Meta

## Introduction
Merkle-Meta creates privacy proofs and software designed to orchestrate data sovereignty while enhancing cross-functional integration and decentralized distribution. Privacy Proofs Made Simple.

## Repositories

### 1. AES256-Encryption-LayerOne
AES256-Encryption-LayerOne is a robust tool for AES256 encryption and decryption, compatible with both Linux and Windows platforms. This tool is designed to handle JSON data generated by web forms, encrypting each individual input with a unique key and generating a nonce to prevent collisions. It is suitable for storing data on decentralized storage systems like IPFS and Filecoin. For secure content sharing, we recommend using asymmetric encryption to share the encryption keys. We plan to develop a repository for this functionality in the future. The encryption system is highly capable, managing hundreds of inputs efficiently.

### 2. Merkle-Proof
The Merkle-Proof repository deploys a comprehensive Merkle tree that includes built-in security features and is optimized for web forms. As long as the input data is formatted correctly in JSON, it can process hundreds of inputs per Merkle tree. The tool generates a Merkle root and allows for the creation of customizable Merkle proofs based on the data shared. Combined with public data, this tool can mimic zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and is particularly robust for larger data sets, such as medical data, training records, educational records, HR documents, and more.
